# MindOverCloud

Hi and Welcome to my Github Repository.

Firstly, let me start by introducing myself and then what this Github Repository will serve for the Tech Community as well as myself.
So, I'm Joseph Gooderham and I currently work for the most accredited Microsoft Partner globally in the UK, called Transparity.
I'm employed as a Technical Consultant in the Azure Practice and essentially my role is to work on Projects across various sectors in Digital Transformations to and within the Microsoft Azure Platform.
I've got a background in Cloud Technology working with previous award winning MSP's in Private and Hybrid Cloud as well as Microsoft 365 Cloud migrations and then later decided to specialise in Azure.

Typical Projects include large migration programmes from Lift and Shift, Innovation and Greenfield environments.
Prior to the Technical piece of these Projects, I also perform a lot of Cloud Adoption Framework workshops with customers to establish their Strategy, Plan and Ready documentation and overall plan before deploying an Azure Landing Zone and 
then adopting the services in scope for transformation.

The purpose of my Github Repo is to provide a Wiki for both useful links, code bases and community driven discussions around common Azure deliverables. By opening up my knowledge to the Community, I welcome learning opportunities and collaboration.
I have a real passion for Detail especially around Cloud document so feel free to comment on anything and everything!
