# MindOverCloud

Hi and Welcome to my Github Repository.

Firstly, let me start by introducing myself and then what this Github Repository will serve for the Tech Community as well as myself.
So, I'm Joseph Gooderham and I currently work for the most accredited Microsoft Partner globally in the UK, called Transparity.
I'm employed as a Technical Consultant in the Azure Practice and essentially my role is to work on Projects across various sectors in Digital Transformations to and within the Microsoft Azure Platform.
I've got a background in Cloud Technology working with previous award winning MSP's in Private and Hybrid Cloud as well as Microsoft 365 Cloud migrations and then later decided to specialise in Azure.

Typical Projects include large migration programmes from Lift and Shift, Innovation and Greenfield environments.
Prior to the Technical piece of these Projects, I also perform a lot of Cloud Adoption Framework workshops with customers to establish their Strategy, Plan and Ready documentation and overall plan before deploying an Azure Landing Zone and 
then adopting the services in scope for transformation.

The purpose of my Github Repo is to provide a Wiki for both useful links, code bases and community driven discussions around common Azure deliverables. By opening up my knowledge to the Community, I welcome learning opportunities and collaboration.
I have a real passion for Detail especially around Cloud document so feel free to comment on anything and everything!

As you saw by the Title of this Page - MindOverCloud. To me, a common issue for Engineers moving into the Azure Consulting Space or even during Customer engagements is that assumption that Azure is just like any other Cloud Provider and how you approach a Project is rinse and repeat. Now for some of the Technical items such as an Azure Landing Zone this is definitely true in some elements/circumstances but to really deliver a great piece of work and engagement to a Customer, something I struggled with and am always actively developing, is a Consultant mindset approach to leading engagements and overall delivery of the solution. 

Therefore in this Blog, I'm going to include my approach and steps to being a Consultant. This is a very subjective comment and other people will have different takes on it, so do not take my advice as gospel as you will cater it to your ways of 
working however it is Community driven page and I really do welcome comments and discussions around this topic and if you have any pointers, do share!

Anyway, hope this page helps you solve an issue, give you tips on being 1% a better Consultant or helps you with a nifty script to deploy a resource.

All the best,
Joseph
